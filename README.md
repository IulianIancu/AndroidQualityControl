# Android Quality Control

To increase and track the quality of your code there are serveral tools available. Aside from continuous integration (CI) tools like Jenkins and test coverage with Jacoco shown in <a href="https://github.com/nomisRev/AndroidGradleJacoco">Android Jacoco Gradle</a>, there are some static code analysis tools out there like <a href="https://pmd.github.io/">PMD</a>, <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">Findbugs</a> and <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a>

##### Static code analysis
> Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs (analysis performed on executing programs is known as dynamic analysis). In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of the source code, and in the other cases, some form of the object code.

In other words, it is a tool that is going to analyse our code and point out bugs, mistakes, pitfalls. **This is a tool and so it doens't work miracles!**

You can expect it to point out unused code, redudant code, unchecked potetional NPE's etc
